Question 4
What is prop drilling?
a. Prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a parent to a child component, then to a grandchild component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further down the component tree, where this data is required
b. Prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a child, to a parent component, then to a grandparent component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further up the component tree, where this data is required.

Correct -> a
Correct. Prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a parent to a child component, then to a grandchild component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further down the component tree, where this data is required

Question 6
Choose the correct statement.
a. Remember that you should always change the values of props in children components; you should never work with them as they are. In other words, props are mutable.
b. Remember that you should never change the values of props in children components; you should only work with them as they are. In other words, props are immutable.

Correct -> b
That’s correct! Props are immutable and thus you should not attempt to update them in children components.
